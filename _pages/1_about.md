I am a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Prof. Harris Wang at Columbia University. My research interest lies broadly in characterization and engineering of diverse microbes towards understanding their design principles and transforming them into living sensors, therapeutics, and factories. To this end, I develop and utilize a diverse set of systems and synthetic biology tools including high-throughput DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies, massively parallel reporter assays, directed evolution strategies, DNA-based cellular recording systems, and cell-free gene expression systems.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from KAIST, where I worked with Prof. Ki Jun Jeong. My dissertation work focused on developing genetic tools for a food-grade industrial microbe, <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>, and extending its carbon substrate range towards raw plant biomass for consolidated bioprocessing and biomanufacturing.

In the Wang lab, to facilitate studying and engineering of diverse non-model bacterial species, I have devised a cell-free framework to quantitatively characterize thousands of gene regulatory elements in a single <i>in vitro</i> transcription reaction using crude cell lysates. I have also engineered CRISPR adaptation machineries to make bacterial cells sense and record their surroundings over time to create living microbial diagnostics and digital-to-biological data storage devices.

My future research aims to further develop systems and synthetic biology tools, taking them beyond <i>E. coli</i> to diverse non-model bacterial species and their communities in various environments, and use them to develop a variety of new biotechnology applications.
