I am a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Harris Wang's lab at Columbia University. My research employs systems and synthetic biology approaches to better understand and predictably manipulate diverse microbes and their communities in various environments, including closed and defined bioreactors as well as open and natural habitats.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from KAIST, where I worked with Prof. Ki Jun Jeong. My dissertation work focused on developing genetic tools for a food-grade industrial microbe, <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>, and extending its carbon substrate range towards raw plant biomass for consolidated bioprocessing.

In the Wang lab, I have changed gear a bit and engineered bacterial cells to sense and record their surroundings over time to develop living microbial diagnostics and digital data storage devices. Also, to facilitate studying and engineering of genetic parts and circuits in diverse non-model bacterial species, I devised a cell-free framework to quantitatively characterize thousands of gene regulatory elements in a single <i>in vitro</i> reaction.
