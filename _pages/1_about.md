Sung Sun Yim is a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Harris Wang's lab at Columbia University. Sung holds B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where he devised various genetic tools for an industrial microbe, <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>, and expanded its carbon substrate range towards raw biomass for integrated biomanufacturing.

In the Wang lab, Sung has changed gear a bit and is studying gene regulatory compatibility across diverse microbes to better understand and predictably manipulate microbial communities. Sung is also interested in engineering bacterial cells to record their surroundings over time towards living microbial diagnostics and digital data storage devices.
