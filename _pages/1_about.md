Sung Sun Yim is a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Harris Wang's lab at Columbia University. Sung holds B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where he concentrated upon developing genetic tools in an industrial microbe, <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>, and expanding its carbon substrate range towards consolidated bioprocessing.

Currently at the Wang lab, Sung is studying gene regulatory compatibility across diverse microbes to systematically expand host spectrum of synthetic biology and is also engineering cellular memory in DNA of living cells to develop living microbial diagnotics/therapeutics and living data storage devices.
