I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Prof. Harris Wang at Columbia University. My research interest lies broadly in characterization and engineering of diverse microbes towards understanding their design principles and transforming them into living sensors, therapeutics, and factories.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from KAIST with Prof. Ki Jun Jeong. For my dissertation work, I developed genetic tools for a food-grade industrial microbe, <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>, and extended its carbon substrate range towards raw plant biomass for consolidated bioprocessing by integrating all the functions required into a single bacterial strain.

In the Wang lab, beyond engineering of a single microbe, I have been working towards modulating teamwork in microbial communities. To facilitate engineering of non-model bacterial species, I devised a cell-free framework for rapid characterization of thousands of gene regulatory elements in a single <i>in vitro</i> transcription reaction. I have also engineered CRISPR adaptation machineries to make bacterial cell populations sense and record their surroundings over time to create living microbial diagnostics and store digital information.
