I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Prof. Harris Wang at Columbia University. My research interest lies broadly in characterization and engineering of microorganisms towards understanding their design principles and transforming them into living sensors, therapeutics, and factories.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from KAIST with Prof. Ki Jun Jeong. For my dissertation work, I developed genetic tools for a food-grade industrial microbe, <i>C. glutamicum</i>, and extended its carbon substrate range towards raw plant biomass for consolidated bioprocessing.

In the Wang lab, I have been working towards modulating diverse microbes and their interactions in microbial communities. As a first step, I have devised a cell-free framework for rapid characterization of thousands of gene regulatory elements across many bacterial species using crude cell lysates.

I am also developing cellular recording systems to store digital data and measure biologically relevant signals in places that are otherwise difficult to access, such as inside the body.
