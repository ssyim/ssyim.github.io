I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Prof. Harris Wang at Columbia University. My research interest lies broadly in characterization and engineering of diverse microbes and their communities towards understanding their design principles and transforming them into living sensors, therapeutics, and factories.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from KAIST with Prof. Ki Jun Jeong. My dissertation work focused on developing genetic tools for a food-grade industrial microbe, <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>, and extending its carbon substrate range towards raw plant biomass for consolidated bioprocessing and biomanufacturing.

In the Wang lab, I have devised a cell-free framework for rapid characterization of thousands of gene regulatory elements in a single <i>in vitro</i> transcription reaction to facilitate engineering of non-model bacterial species. I have also engineered CRISPR adaptation machineries to make bacterial cells sense and record their surroundings over time to create living microbial diagnostics and store digital data.

My future research aims to further develop scalable systems and synthetic biology tools and techniques, take them beyond <i>E. coli</i> to diverse microbes and their communities in various environments, and use them to create a variety of new biotechnology applications.
