I am a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Harris Wang's lab at Columbia University. My research employs systems and synthetic biology approaches to better understand and predictably manipulate diverse microbes and their communities in various environments.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from KAIST, where I worked with Prof. Ki Jun Jeong. My dissertation work focused on developing genetic tools for an industrial microbe, <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>, and expanding its carbon substrate range towards raw biomass for consolidated bioprocessing (Yim et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 2013; Yim et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 2016; Yim et al., ACS Synth Biol 2016; Yim et al., Biotechnol J 2017).

In the Wang lab, I devised a cell-free framework to quantitatively characterize transcriptional activities of thousands of bacterial gene regulatory elements (Yim et al., Mol Syst Biol 2019; Yim et al., ACS Synth Biol 2020). I have also been engineering bacterial cells to record their surroundings over time to develop living microbial diagnostics and digital data storage devices (Sheth et al., Science 2017; Yim et al., In Revision 2020).
